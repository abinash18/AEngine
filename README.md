#Java Game Engine.

The reason why there is so much line spacing is:
-Space left for documenting the code afterwards (I know it better to comment as you are you are coding but what eves.)
-And I wanted it to look like there was more code than there actually was. Then I can say; Hey i just wrote 3000 lines of code help me get a girlfriend.
